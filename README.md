https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkJ9keBmQWo&t=2955s - Entity Framework Best Practices - Should EFCore Be Your Data Access of Choice?

* Introduction

In this project I intend to learn more about the EntityFrameworkCore package.
The EntityFrameworkCore is used as an object-relational mapper (O/RM), but what does an ORM do? ORM is usefull to eliminate the need of coding in SQL and makes it possible to access the database using migrations, which are convenients to update the content of the database according to the application without loosing the existing data.

* Technical Analisys

- Technical Environment Description

The system is compesed by a database and a web application.

- Main functionallities
Access to the database using an object-relational mapper.
Update and keep the database in sync with the application's data models

The tools used to develop the system include C#, a back-end programming language, there is no intention to create a front-end in the application. The Data Base Management System(DBMS) chosen was SQL Server.

* Conclusion

During the development of this application I will be able to practice and learn the concepts of EFCore, anyone can follow and send a feedback in my e-mail: wrsnunes@gmail.com.
